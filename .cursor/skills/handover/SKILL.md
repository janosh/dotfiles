# Handover

## When to use

- Session is ending and context should be transferred cleanly
- Complex work needs continuity for the next agent/session

## Instructions

1. Review session activity and branch state.
2. Generate `HANDOVER.md` with:
   - What was done
   - Current state and blockers
   - Key decisions and rationale
   - Pitfalls and lessons
   - Open questions
   - Next steps
   - Files changed

## Rules

- Capture rationale, not only actions
- Include concrete paths and actionable next steps
